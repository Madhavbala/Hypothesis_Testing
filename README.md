Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis:

A hypothesis is a statement about a population that we want to verify based on the information contained in a sample. For example, the statement "Messi is a good captain" can be verified by examining the entire population (whole country) such as Argentina or Brazil, with the sample being a selection of captains.

Hypothesis Testing:

Hypothesis testing is the process of examining a whole population to determine if a statistical hypothesis is correct. For instance, we may assume that Messi is the best captain based on the average win and loss under his captaincy.

Main Purpose of Hypothesis Testing:

The main purpose of hypothesis testing is to test whether the null hypothesis (no difference, no effect) can be rejected or accepted. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the research hypothesis can be accepted, and if the null hypothesis is accepted, then the research hypothesis is rejected.

Terminology:

Population: The entire set of data under consideration.
Sample: A subset of individuals selected from the population based on a specific statement.
Parameter: A summary description of a fixed characteristic of the target population, such as mean, variance, or standard deviation.
Sampling Distribution: A statistic obtained through a large number of samples drawn from a specific population.
Sample Error: A measure of the spread of sample data, similar to standard deviation, while standard deviation is used for the population.
Types of Hypothesis:

Null Hypothesis [H0]
Alternative Hypothesis [H1]
Null Hypothesis [H0]: It is the hypothesis that the event won't happen and is assumed to be true before collecting the data. If the null hypothesis is approved, no changes will be made. For example, "Messi is the best captain in the world" or "Corona vaccine is not going to stop the corona" can be null hypotheses.

Alternative Hypothesis [H1]: It is the hypothesis that the event will happen. It is what we want to prove to be true with our collected data. It states that some difference or effect is expected. Rejection of the null hypothesis leads to acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. For example, when the null hypothesis fails, we may have an alternative hypothesis such as "Messi can
manage to win against India" or "Corona vaccine will effectively stop the spread of the virus."

One-tailed test:

A test in which the critical area of a distribution is one-sided, either greater or less than a certain value, but not both. If the sample falls into the one-sided critical area,
the alternative hypothesis will be accepted instead of the null hypothesis.

Left-sided hypothesis
Right-sided hypothesis
Two-tailed test:

A test in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. If the sample falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted over the null hypothesis.

Simple Hypothesis vs. Composite Hypothesis:

Simple Hypothesis: A hypothesis that completely specifies the distribution of the population.
Composite Hypothesis: A hypothesis that doesn't completely specify the distribution of the population.
Type-I Error:

Type-I error occurs when the sample results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. It is equivalent to false positives, rejecting a true null hypothesis.
