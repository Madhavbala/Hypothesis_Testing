Hypothesis Testing

*)Hypothesis *)Hypothesis_Testing *)Main purpose of the Hypothesis_testing *)Terminology *)Steps of Hypothesis testing 

Hypothesis :
   It is a statement about the population which we want to verify on the basis of information which contained in a sample. Ex : Messi is a good captain . If I take the whole country Argentina,Brazil etc.. and I have the statement Messi is the best captain to verify a statement weather it right or wrong that is possible in the information of samples.
   Whole country   == > Population
   Select captains ==> Sample
   
 Hypothesis Testing :
   To decide if a statistical hypothesis is correct is to examine a whole population. Ex : This Assumbtion (Messi is the best captain) we are making based on average win and lose under his captaincy
   
Main purpose of the Hypothesis_testing : 
   The purpose of hypothesis testing is to test whether the null hypothesis (there is no difference, no effect) can be rejected or approved. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the research hypothesis can be accepted. If the null hypothesis is accepted, then the research hypothesis is rejected.
   
Terminology : 
 *) Population : The Whole data
 *) Sample : Certain amount of people in the population based on statement
 *) Parameter : It is a summary discription of a fixed characterstic of the target population. Ex : (Mean,Variance,Standard deviation) If I want to take the average winning rate of population that can be possible in parameter
 *) Sapmling distribution : statistic obtained through a large number of samples drawn from a specific population. Ex : we can take any parameter that is going to apply a large number of samples in a population.
 *) sample error : Similar to standard deviation but here the measure of spread of samole data , where's standard deviation is for population.
   
   Standard deviation --> For population
   Standard Error --> For Sample
   
 *)Types of Hypothesis : 1) Null Hypothesis [H0] 2) Alternative Hypothesis [H1]
  
  Null Hypothesis [H0]:
    .) Hypothesis that the event won't happen
    .) Hypothesis assumed to be true before we collecting the data,If null hypothesis approved no changes will made. 
      Ex : Hypothesis --> Messi is the best captain in the world 
           Null Hypothesis --> Messi can't manage to win against India or Corona vaccine is not going to stop the corona.
         
   Alternative Hypothesis [H1] : Whenever the null hypothesis is fail ten we go for a alternative hypothesis.
     .) Hypothesis that the event will happen 
     .) This is what we want to prove to be true with out collected data
     .) A statemnt that some differance or effect is expected 
     .) The rejection of null hypothesis will leads to acceptance of alternative hypothesis (if any changes of increasing ot changes a value is known as alternative hypothesis)
     
 *) One tailed test : Test in which critical area of a distribution in one sided so that is either greater or less than a certain value but not both , If the sample being falls into the one sided critical area the alternative hypothesis will be accepted instead of the Null hypothesis.
  
  .) Left sided hypothesis .) Righr sided hypothesis
  
 *) Two tailed hypothesis : Test in which the critical area of a distribution is tow-sided and tests weather a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. If the sample being testes falls into either of critical areas the alternative hypothesis is accepted of the null hypothesis.
  
  
  Simple Hypothesis    ---|
                          | ->  Based on probability distribution 
  Composite Hypothesis ---|
   
   .) Simple Hypothesis    : Hypothesis completly specifies the distribution of the population.
   .) Composite Hypothesis : Hypothesis doesn't completly specifies the distribution of the population.
     
  *)Type-1 Error : Error occurs when the sample results leads to the rejection of null hypothesis when it is in fact true, It is equivalent to false positives. When you reject a true null hypothesis.

|                                | Null Hypothesis is true  | Null hypothesis is false  |
                           
| Reject null hypothesis         | Type Error (FP)          | Correct outcome (TP)      |

| Fail to reject null hypothesis | Correct outcome (TN)     | Type Error (FN)           |
